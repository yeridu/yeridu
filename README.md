# Hi, I'm Mario Morales

**Doctoral Researcher** | **Computational Social Scientist** | **Prevention Scientist**

I weave ethnographic depth with computational precision to understand and prevent health risks across borders. My work focuses on adolescent dating violence, substance use, and mental health — using mixed methods, NLP, and machine learning to identify population-level patterns that inform intervention design.

## Research Focus

My research examines the intersection of **dating violence** and **substance use** among adolescents, investigating:

- How school-based interventions can prevent both violence and substance use simultaneously
- Whether bystander programs like **Green Dot** reduce victim-blaming attitudes
- How sexual orientation moderates risk for teen dating violence victimization
- Population-level protective factors across the U.S., Mexico, Belize, and South Africa

*All methods are useful; all outcomes are connected.*
